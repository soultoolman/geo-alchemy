# geo-alchemy
a Python library and command line tool to make GEO data into gold.

## why geo-alchemy

GEO is like a gold mine that contains a huge many gold ore.
But processing these gold ore(GEO series) into gold(expression matrix, clinical data) is not very easy:

1. how to map microarray probe to gene?
2. how about multiple probes map to same gene?
3. hot to get clinical data?
4. ...

geo-alchemy was born to deal with it.
